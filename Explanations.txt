This is a project to work on a specific part of an Escape Room scenario named "Mission: Hollywood". 
In the last room, the players find a secret Headquarters (James Bond / Mission Impossible vibes).
They need to do a series of puzzles in order to free an actors named Tim Ferris, that has been captured by a "bad guy" woman. 
There are 5 puzzles the players need to solve.

- A "Simon" to regain control of the HQ: on the console there are screens and stuff that are inactive / scrambled, the only thing that is "working" are buttons that light up for a short time, randomly, one by one, and the players need to press on the button when they are lit in order to valide it. This puzzle is solved when all the buttons have been pressed.

- This actives the main screen, which is a view of the world map, with a horizontal & vertical line acting as a crosshair. Next to that screen on the console are 2 round rotary buttons, as well as 2 headsets. When the players turn the buttons, it moves the horizontal or vertical line respectively, and as feedback with the headsets they can hear a "beep" that becomes more frequent as they come close to the destination that is supposed to show where the actor is. When both horizontal and vertical lines are in the correct position, it solves this puzzle.

- This opens up a secret trap where some spy gadgets can be found, with a code next to each gadget. On another screen, a virtual assistant explains that the players need to find the right gadget to free Tim who is currently captured. On the console there is numpad with 3 diodes. For each situation, when the players type in the correct gadget (code), a diode turns green. After the 3 have been entered, it solves this puzzle.

- The virtual assistant then explains that they need to find the correct vehicle in order for Tim to escape. There is a screen that displays a spinning 3D view of a vehicle, and the players can navigate left and right. Each vehicle has its own code. On the console, there are levers with say 5 numbers for each level, depending on its position / angle. There is a "Validate" button next to the levers, so that when the players have entered a code, they press the button to "send" it to Tim. Depending on if the vehicle is correct or not, the assistant gives corresponding feedback. After the last vehicle is chosen, it solves this puzzle.

- The last step is to avoid a missile from detonating and destroying the world, that the villain has just sent in retaliation for Tim's escape. On the world map sceen, the players see the trajectory of the missile, in the form of horizontal and vertical lines, going from one major city to the next. What they need to do, is revert the missile and go back to the origin, which is where the villain is. With the help of a joystick, they need to go left, up & down, and follow the same path but backwards. A bit similar like a directional padlock, but more fun and interactive. When the missile has reached the point of origin again, they officially win the game.
