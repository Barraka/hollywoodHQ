## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Finish Sora test** - See if quality meets expectations
2. **Choose voiceover method** - AI (ElevenLabs) or record yourself
3. **Generate visuals** - Use Sora, or fallback to Runway/Pika
4. **Sync audio + video** - Combine in video editor if separate
5. **Export and deploy** - Drop into puzzle directories, test

---

## 💡 Alternative: Placeholder Videos

If video generation is taking too long, create **temporary placeholder videos** to test puzzle logic:

**Quick Placeholder with PowerPoint/Keynote:**
1. Create slides with text for each clip
2. Export as video (PowerPoint → File → Export → Video)
3. Use for testing while generating final videos

**Why:** Get the gameplay working first, polish visuals later.

## 📞 Ready for Review

Once you've generated a few test clips:
- Show them to a friend/teammate
- Does the tone match Mission: Hollywood theme?
- Is dialogue clear and understandable?
- Are vehicles recognizable and appealing?

I can adjust scripts/prompts based on your feedback!
